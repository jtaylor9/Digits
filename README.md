# Digits

Implementation of a simple address book.

# Usage
To invoke the application for the first, use this in terminal:

```
meteor --settings ../config/settings.development.json
```

Or, if you are in production, you might want to use:

```
meteor --settings ../config/settings.production.json
```

The settings files will set up the user accounts.

# Application Screenshots
[Note: May need to adjust screen resolution to see clearly. High resolution settings for best results]
The home page for the application looks like this:
